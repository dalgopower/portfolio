# Ji Jimmy Youn

I live and work in Seoul, South Korea.
I am a backend software developer and am specialized with Node.js.

As well-experienced full-stack software developer with a passion, I have led projects to completion given various conditions. I did not hesitate to learn and adapt myself to new languages/skills throughout projects.

I am...
- Cautious : I do not jump on conclusions or acts without preliminary study

- Methodical : I make a list of things to do and prioritize them.

- Responsible : I do my work.
